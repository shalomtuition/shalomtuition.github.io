Only Your mercy only Your grace
Only Your Spirit brings us to faith
O what a wonder that You chose us first
Not by our merit but Your perfect work

Only Your goodness only Your love
Only Your pardon poured out in blood
Your righteousnes exchanged for our sin
Oh what a Savior oh what a friend

Jesus we long to worship You
And give You all glory and praise
All that You are
All that You have
We have received by faith
